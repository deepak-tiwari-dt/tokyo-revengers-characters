    <b>Takemichi Hanagaki</b> (花垣はながき 武道タケミチ, Hanagaki
    Takemichi?), or <b>Takemitchy</b> (タケミっち, Takemicchi?), is the
    protagonist of the <em>Tokyo Revengers</em> manga series as well as its
    <em> anime adaptation. </em> <br /> <br />
    After learning about the <b>deaths</b> of the Tachibana siblings, one of
    which was his ex-girlfriend <b>Hinata Tachibana</b>, Takemichi
    time-leaps exactly twelve years back in time. Through his time-leaping
    ability, he learns about the infamous <b>Tokyo Manji Gang</b>, a middle
    school biker gang in the past that is responsible for Hina’s death in
    the present. After unintentionally rescuing Hina’s younger brother
    <b> Naoto Tachibana </b> from the incident, Takemichi becomes determined
    to work with him to save Hina from an unfavorable future. <br /> <br />
    During his time leaps, Takemichi uncovers the Tokyo Manji Gang's history
    and how it was shaped into becoming a criminal organization in the
    present. Takemichi becomes a member of the gang and soon, the First
    Division Captain (壱番隊 隊長, Ichiban-tai Taichō?). His involvement in

    later, he becomes the leader of the Second Generation Tokyo Manji Gang.
    In his <b>final time leap</b>, he becomes the Acting President
